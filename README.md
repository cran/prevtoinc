The \strong{prevtoinc} package implements functionality to simulate point-prevalence studies (PPSs) for healtcare-associated infections (HAIs) and estimate incidence based on the PPS data. It is a companion package to the preprint [Willrich et al., From prevalence to incidence - a new approach in the hospital setting;
 doi:10.1101/554725](https://www.doi.org/10.1101/554725) ,  where methods are explained in detail.
 
 For an introduction to the use of the package have a look at the accompanying vignette 'prevtoinc_vignette'.
