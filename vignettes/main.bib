Prevalence odds is shown to be a weighted average of age-specific products between incidence and discounted disease duration. If and only if the covariance between incidence and duration is zero, does prevalence odds equal the product of average incidence and average duration. The product of averages is shown typically to overestimate prevalence in epidemiologic applications. Ignoring population growth also tends to lead to overestimation of prevalence.},

Data may be collected in the most expedient manner, either as prevalence or incidence series of cases, and the results expressed as both incidence and prevalence. Information about the distribution of total durations of the condition in an incidence series of cases, or about the distribution of total durations or durations-to-date in a prevalence series is necessary in order to use these relations between prevalence and incidence of a condition or illness. The duration of a condition may be taken as one measure of the effect of the condition or illness on a population, and a “treatment effect” measured by comparing two populations may be termed the etiologic duration. Exact methods are presented for interconverting the distribution of total durations of condition among prevalence and incidence series of cases arising from the same steady-state population. Both prevalence and incidence series of cases may naturally arise in the same epidemiologic study, such as the initiation and conduct of a periodic screening program, and under certain conditions the size and even the direction of the etiologic duration may differ as measured in corresponding prevalence and incidence series of cases.},

DESIGN.  Comparison of observed and calculated incidence data and prevalence data. SETTING.  One 8‐week incidence investigation in the surgical and intensive care units of eight medium‐sized hospitals; three separate point‐prevalence studies in the same units. RESULTS.  The overall prevalence observed after the three prevalence studies in 2,169 patients was 6.8% (95% confidence interval [CI95], 5.7‐8.0). In 2,882 discharged patients observed during the incidence study, the mean hospitalization was 9.8 days; patients with one or more nosocomial infection had a mean hospitalization time of 22.3 days and a mean interval of 8.2 days from admission to the first day of infection. Based on these data, the overall calculated incidence was 4.7%, whereas the observed incidence was 4.3% (CI95, 3.6‐5.2). Vice versa, an overall prevalence of 6.2% was found when calculated from the observed incidence data. The incidence data calculated from prevalence data also were within the confidence interval of the incidences observed for urinary tract infections and surgical‐site infections. (However, it was not possible to convert the data for two of the eight hospitals.) CONCLUSION.  The approximate mathematical relationship between the prevalence and incidence data of nosocomial infection is confirmed by this study. However, although it is theoretically possible, we would not recommend the conversion of prevalence into incidence data or vice versa.},

  abstract = {In epidemiology incidence denotes the rate of occurrence of new cases (of disease), while prevalence is the frequency in the population (of diseased people). From a statistical point of view it is useful to understand incidence and prevalence in the parameter space, incidence as intensity (hazard) and prevalence as probability, and to relate observable quantities to these via a statistical model. In this paper such a framework is based on modelling each individual's dynamics in the Lexis diagram by a simple three-state stochastic process in the age direction and recruiting individuals from a Poisson process in the time direction. The resulting distributions in the cross-sectional population allow a rigorous discussion of the interplay between age-specific incidence and prevalence as well as of the statistical analysis of epidemiological cross-sectional data. For the latter, this paper focuses on methods from modern nonparametric continuous time survival analysis, including random censoring and truncation models and estimation under monotonicity constraints. The exposition is illustrated by examples, primarily from the author's epidemiological experience.},

Longer hospital stay was associated with a greater risk of developing HAI, but the strength of the association was different for the two measures used. Day-specific incidence rates were found to vary, with a peak between the 14th and 19th days of hospitalisation. Similar patterns were observed when the data were stratified by age, sex and operation. Methods for calculating HAI should control for the length of hospital stay. Further studies are required to clarify the mechanisms that affect the temporal pattern of incidence of HAI observed with length of hospitalisation.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE.  To reduce the number of nosocomial infections (NIs) in surgical patients by a quality management approach. DESIGN.  Prospective, controlled study in 8 medium‐sized hospitals during a 26‐month period. SETTING.  Four study hospitals and 4 control hospitals. METHODS.  In two 10‐month intervention periods, 4 external physicians introduced quality circles and ongoing surveillance in the 4 study hospitals. There were three 8‐week observation periods in all 8 hospitals with the same physicians before, during, and after the intervention periods. RESULTS.  During the first observation period, almost identical overall incidence densities were found for the study hospitals and the control hospitals. During the course of the study, the overall incidence density decreased significantly in the study hospitals (risk ratio [RR], 0.74; 95% confidence interval [CI95], 0.59 to 0.94) and nonsignificantly in the control hospitals (RR, 0.90; CI95, 0.70 to 1.16). With the use of a Cox regression model to evaluate the impact of the intervention periods while taking into account the distribution of risk factors for NI in both groups, a significant risk reduction (RR, 0.75; CI95, 0.58 to 0.97) was observed after the first intervention period when comparing study and control hospitals. At the end of the study (ie, after the second intervention period), the difference between the study hospitals and the control hospitals was not significant (RR, 0.78; CI95, 0.60 to 1.01). This was due to no further improvement at the end of the study in the study hospitals and a decrease in the control hospitals. CONCLUSION.  This study demonstrates that NI rates can be significantly reduced by appropriate intervention methods in hospitals that are interested in quality management activities. However, continuous intense efforts are necessary to maintain these improvements.},

  abstract     = {Point-prevalence surveys (PPSs) are often used to estimate the prevalence of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs). Methods for estimating incidence of HAIs from prevalence have been developed, but application of these methods is often difficult because key quantities, like the average length of infection, cannot be derived directly from the data available in a PPS. We propose a new theory-based method to estimate incidence from prevalence data dealing with these limitations and compare it to other estimation methods in a simulation study. In contrast to previous methods, our method does not depend on any assumptions on the underlying distributions of length of infection and length of stay. As a basis for the simulation study we use data from the second study of nosocomial infections in Germany (Nosokomiale Infektionen in Deutschland, Erfassung und Praevention - NIDEP2) and the European surveillance of HAIs in intensive care units (HAI-Net ICU). The new method compares favourably with the other estimation methods and has the advantage of being consistent in its behaviour across the different setups. It is implemented in an R-package prevtoinc which will be freely available on CRAN (http://cran.r-project.org/).},
